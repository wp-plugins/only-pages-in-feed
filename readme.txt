== Description ==

'Only Pages in Feed' is a little plugin that modifies WordPress RSS feed to exclude all 'Post' types and show only 'Pages' in it. So if you are using WordPress as a CMS and want only Pages to appear in your site feed, this plugin is for you.

The plugin needs no configuration. Just activate it, and you are good to go. Deactivating the plugin restores RSS feeds to their default state.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just activated the plugin, why don't I see pages in my feed? =

If you're using Feedburner you'll have to wait until your updated feed is picked up by Feedburner. This isn't immediate so give it a few hours.

= How do I change number of pages in feed? =

Just like blog posts, number of pages in feed are also controlled from 'Reading Settings' in WordPress dashboard.

= Where are the settings? =

There are no settings. Once the plugin is activated, all your exisiting and new pages are automatically included in the WordPress RSS feed.
